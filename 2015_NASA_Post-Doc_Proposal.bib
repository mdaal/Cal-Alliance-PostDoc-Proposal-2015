abstract = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a 10 m diameter, wide-field, offset Gregorian telescope with a 966 pixel, multicolor, millimeter-wave, bolometer camera. It is located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica. The design of the SPT emphasizes careful control of spillover and scattering, to minimize noise and false signals due to ground pickup. The key initial project is a large-area survey at wavelengths of 3, 2, and 1.3 mm, to detect clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and to measure the small-scale angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The data will be used to characterize the primordial matter power spectrum and to place constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. A second-generation camera will measure the polarization of the CMB, potentially leading to constraints on the neutrino mass and the energy scale of inflation.},

abstract = {We present the status of MUSIC, the MUltiwavelength Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera, a new instrument for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. MUSIC is designed to have a 14', diffraction-limited field-of-view instrumented with 2304 detectors in 576 spatial pixels and four spectral bands at 0.87, 1.04, 1.33, and 1.98 mm. MUSIC will be used to study dusty star-forming galaxies, galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and star formation in our own and nearby galaxies. MUSIC uses broadband superconducting phased-array slot-dipole antennas to form beams, lumpedelement on-chip bandpass filters to define spectral bands, and microwave kinetic inductance detectors to sense incoming light. The focal plane is fabricated in 8 tiles consisting of 72 spatial pixels each. It is coupled to the telescope via an ambient-temperature ellipsoidal mirror and a cold reimaging lens. A cold Lyot stop sits at the image of the primary mirror formed by the ellipsoidal mirror. Dielectric and metal-mesh filters are used to block thermal infrared and out-ofband radiation. The instrument uses a pulse tube cooler and 3He/ 3He/4He closed-cycle cooler to cool the focal plane to below 250 mK. A multilayer shield attenuates Earth's magnetic field. Each focal plane tile is read out by a single pair of coaxes and a HEMT amplifier. The readout system consists of 16 copies of custom-designed ADC/DAC and IF boards coupled to the CASPER ROACH platform. We focus on recent updates on the instrument design and results from the commissioning of the full camera in 2012.},

@article{Hansryd2002,
abstract = {An applications-oriented review of optical parametric amplifiers in fiber communications is presented. The emphasis is on parametric amplifiers in general and single pumped parametric amplifiers in particular. While a theoretical framework based on highly efficient four-photon mixing is provided, the focus is on the intriguing applications enabled by the parametric gain, such as all-optical signal sampling, time-demultiplexing, pulse generation, and wavelength conversion. As these amplifiers offer high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation, they are also candidate enablers to increase overall wavelength-division-multiplexing system capacities similar to the more well-known Raman amplifiers. Similarities and distinctions between Raman and parametric amplifiers are also addressed. Since the first fiber-based parametric amplifier experiments providing net continuous-wave gain in the for the optical fiber communication applications interesting 1.5-{\&}amp;mu;m region were only conducted about two years ago, there is reason to believe that substantial progress may be made in the future, perhaps involving "holey fibers" to further enhance the nonlinearity and thus the gain. This together with the emergence of practical and inexpensive high-power pump lasers may in many cases prove fiber-based parametric amplifiers to be a desired implementation in optical communication systems},

@article{HoEom2012a,
abstract = {Amplifiers are ubiquitous in electronics and play a fundamental role in a wide range of scientific measurements. From a user's perspective, an ideal amplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a high dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little distortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise remains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers and are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power from a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely reactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the quantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow band and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a superconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The amplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a dielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on either side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added noise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic range is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the concept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave bands.},

The proposed constant-radius probe couples thin-film microstrip line, to full-height rectangular waveguide with better than 99{\%} efficiency (VSWR less than or equal to 1.20) and 45{\%} fractional bandwidth. Extensive HFSS simulations, backed by scale-model measurements, are presented in the paper. By selecting the substrate material and probe radius, any real impedance between approximate to 15-60 Omega can be achieved. The radial probe gives significantly improved performance over other designs discussed in the literature.

Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved.

This amplifier is a nearly degenerate superconducting parametric amplifier at X-band consisting of a low $\beta$, thin film, single junction SQUID, a monolithic 50 $\Omega$ to 1 $\Omega$ impedance matching network, and a cooled circulator. Nb/Nb2O5/Pb alloy junctions were incorporated into Nb and Pb-in circuitry on 1×2 cm silicon chips. The SQUID was phase-biased near 90° and driven by an external pump at approximately twice the operating frequency. The self-resonance frequency of the SQUID inductance and junction capacitance was set at the operating frequency of 8.2GHz. The operating charac teristics depended on the pump amplitude, the junction phase bias, and the SQUID parameters. For small values of $\beta$< 1 , the maximum gain in both the signal and idler channels was ≈10dB, the bandwidth = 170MHz, and the single-sidehand noise temperature was 6K with an uncertainty of (+15 to -7)K. For higher $\beta$, the gain increased to nearly 30dB with increased noise and parametric oscillations occurring near the pump subharmonic frequency.},

abstract = {We find that the parametric four-photon gain for light pulses decreases for fibers longer than a characteristic length. This length is related to the common experimental observation that stimulated parametric emission is usually prominent only in short fibers while in long fibers stimulated Raman scattering dominates. Despite the fact that the actual process involves an intensity dependent bandwidth and broadening of the pump linewidth from self-phase modulation, it is possible to develop a simple expression for the characteristic length which requires only the initial pump linewidth and the low-power parametric bandwidth. This bandwidth can often be estimated from the pump wavelength and the measured frequency shift between the pump and the generated waves. Expressions for gain and amplification are derived from coupled wave equations and in the Appendixes it is shown that these are of the same form as the planewave equations, but modified by coupling coefficients called overlap integrals.},
